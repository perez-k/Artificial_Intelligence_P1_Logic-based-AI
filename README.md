## Topics covered
📚 Topics Covered include:

0. Search \
[Lecture notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/notes/0/), [Files](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/0/) \
Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move. \
Uninformed search (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search) -  Informed search (Greedy Best-First Search [use heuristic function], A* Search [use heuristic and cost estimation]) - Adversarial search (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Depth-Limited Minimax)

1. Knowledge \
[Lecture notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/notes/1/), [Files](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/1/) \
Representing information and drawing inferences from it. (Knowledge-Based Agent)\
Inference: determine if KB ⊨ α [does KB entails α?] (in other words, answering the question: “can we conclude that α is true based on our knowledge base”) \
Propositional Logic with logical connector: [not(¬P); and(P ∧ Q); inclusive or(P ∨ Q); exclusive or(P ⊕ Q); implication(P → Q); biconditional(P ↔ Q)] \
First Order Logic: more succinct with Constant Symbols (objects) and Predicate Symbols (relations)

2. Uncertainty \
[Lecture notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/notes/2/), [Files](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/2/) \
Dealing with uncertain events using probability to create AI that makes optimal decisions given limited information and uncertainty.
Probability: 0 < P(ω) < 1; $\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} P(\omega) = 1$ \
Conditional Probability:  P(a | b) [probability of a given b] $P(a \mid b) = \dfrac{P(a \land b)}{P(b)}$ \
Random variable: Eg Roll, fair dice that can take on the values {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  Eg Flight P(Flight = on time) = 0.6, P(Flight = delayed) = 0.3, P(Flight = canceled) = 0.1  | Probability distribution can be represented more succinctly as a vector. For example, P(Flight) = <0.6, 0.3, 0.1>. \
Independance: P(a ∧ b) = P(a)P(b). \
Bayes’ Rule: $P(a \mid b) = \dfrac{P(a)\. P(b \mid a)}{P(b)}$ \
Other Probability Rules: Negation: P(¬a) = 1 - P(a);  Inclusion-Exclusion: P(a ∨ b) = P(a) + P(b) - P(a ∧ b);  Marginalization: P(a) = P(a, b) + P(a, ¬b)




4. Optimization \
Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a better—or the best—way to solve it.

5. Learning \
Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience.

6. Neural Networks \
A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively.

7. Language \
Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans.
