## **Knights and Knaves Logic Solver** – CS50 AI (Propositional Logic)

---

### **Description**  
A Python program that models and solves **Knights and Knaves** logic puzzles using **propositional logic** and **model checking**.  
In these puzzles, each character is either a Knight (always tells the truth) or a Knave (always lies).  
The program constructs logical expressions representing each puzzle (knowledge base)nand uses inference to determine who is a Knight or Knave.

---

### **Key CS/AI Concepts**
- **Knowledge representation** with propositional symbols and logical connectives.  
- **Model checking** through truth-table enumeration to test logical entailment.  
- **Logical inference** to derive conclusions that hold in all satisfying models.  
- **Symbolic reasoning** and **abstraction** for building complex logic formulas.
