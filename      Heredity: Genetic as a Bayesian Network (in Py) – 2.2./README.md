# **Heredity: Genetic as a Bayesian Network ** 

---

## **Description**
A Python program that models **genetic inheritance** and **trait expression** using a **Bayesian network**.  
Given a family’s relationships (parents/children) and evidence about who exhibits a trait, the program computes the **posterior probability** that each person has **0, 1, or 2 copies** of a gene and whether they **exhibit the trait**, accounting for **mutation rates** and **Mendelian inheritance**.

### **Key CS/AI Concepts**
- **Bayesian networks & conditional probability tables (CPTs)** for representing uncertain genetic relationships with inheritance and mutation rules
- **Inference by enumeration** (summing over hidden variables) to compute posterior probabilities  
- **Joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities** computation
- **Normalization of probability distributions**
