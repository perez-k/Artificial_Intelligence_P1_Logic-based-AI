## **Minesweeper Inference Engine ** – (Knowledge Representation)

---

### **Description**  
A Python program that plays the game **Minesweeper** intelligently using **propositional logic and inference**.  
The AI maintains a knowledge base of known safe cells and mines, updates it with new information from each move, and uses logical reasoning to deduce which cells can be safely revealed or should be flagged as mined.

### **Key CS/AI Concepts**
- **Knowledge representation** – encoding game information as logical statements.  
- **Inference engine** – deducing new safe cells and mines from known information.  
- **Constraint satisfaction** – applying logical rules to eliminate uncertainty.  
- **Propositional logic and entailment** – determining valid conclusions from partial data.  
- **Automation of decision-making** based on consistent model updates.
